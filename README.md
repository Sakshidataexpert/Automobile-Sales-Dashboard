# Automobile-Sales-Dashboard
An interactive and dynamic Excel-based business intelligence dashboard designed to analyze multi-year automobile sales performance across countries, cities, and product categories. The dashboard provides actionable insights into revenue, profit, taxation, and product-level performance to support strategic decision-making.

## hort Description / Purpose
The Automobile Sales Dashboard is a data-driven Excel solution built to monitor and evaluate automobile sales performance from 2003–2005. It enables users to analyze revenue trends, profit margins, tax distribution, geographic sales performance, and product-level profitability through interactive filters and visualizations.

This dashboard is ideal for sales managers, business analysts, and decision-makers who need quick insights into regional sales trends and product performance.

## Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Microsoft Excel – Core platform for dashboard development

• 📈 Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts – For dynamic aggregation and summarization

• 🎛 Slicers – Interactive filtering by Year, Country, City, and Product

• 🧮 Advanced Excel Formulas – Used for KPI calculations (Total Profit, Total Tax)

• 🎨 Dashboard Design & Formatting – Custom layout, KPI cards, and consistent theme styling

• 📁 File Format – .xlsx

## Data Source
Source: Kaggle

• The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains automobile sales data from 2003–2005, structured across:
• Multiple countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, etc.)
• Cities within each country
• Product categories (Classic Cars, Vintage Cars, Motorcycles, Trucks & Buses, Planes, Ships, Trains)
• Sales revenue, profit, and tax values
The dataset enables hierarchical analysis (Country → City → Product → Year) and supports multi-dimensional sales performance evaluation.

## Features / Highlights
## • Business Problem

Automobile sales organizations operate across multiple countries and product lines, making it difficult to quickly evaluate:

• Which countries generate the highest revenue?

• Which products are most profitable?

• How does tax impact overall profitability?

• Which cities drive the highest sales volume?

• What are the year-over-year sales trends?

Raw spreadsheets make these insights difficult to extract efficiently.

## • Goal of the Dashboard
To design a centralized, interactive reporting solution that:
• Tracks total profit and total tax performance
• Compares yearly sales trends (2003–2005)
• Analyzes country-wise revenue contribution
• Evaluates product-level profitability
• Identifies high-performing cities by sales count
